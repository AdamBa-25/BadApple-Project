# BadApple-Project

## What is the project about ? 

This project is about a rendering of the video [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8&list=RDFtutLA63Cp8&start_radio=1) on the command prompt.

I am a student in first year of Computer Science and this is a beginner project mostly made during my free time.

## How is it gonna work ?

### Idea NÂ°1 (16/10/2025) :

The idea here is to make a 'fake' rendering on the cmd.

To put it simply, the script is gonna cut the video Bad Apple in frames and analyze each frames.
Each white pixel while be asigned a specific value and the black ones another. Those will then be added into a 2 dimension Array.
The objective is then to consecutively print each array with a clear of the console in between each frames to simulate a screen rendering.

I have absolutely no idea on how to do that, but my first sub-objective is to make a script that will take a 2 dimension array of 0 and 1 and accordingly display a string of this exact array.
